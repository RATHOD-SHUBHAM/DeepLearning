# SAHI + YOLOV8

Object identification is by far the most important use of computer vision.\ 
However, identifying small objects and inference on large images remain significant challenges.\
The task of recognizing and localizing objects that are small in size inside digital images is referred to as small object detection.\
I've used the SAHI library in conjunction with the YOLOv8 model to produce outstanding enhancements in object recognition results.

SAHI is an acronym that stands for Slicing Aided Hyper Inference.\
SAHI uses the power of slicing-aided inference and fine-tuning approaches to revolutionize object detection.\
In this section, I've compared small object detection results obtained without and with SAHI.\
SAHI delivers a game-changing slicing-assisted fine-tuning approach that raises detection accuracy to unprecedented heights.
