# DeepLearning
Deep learning (also known as deep structured learning) is part of machine learning methods based on artificial neural networks with representation learning. Learning can be supervised, semi-supervised or unsupervised

## A curated list of my DeepLearning projects: 

### 1] Face recognition:
    The ability to recognise a person face by looking at the digital image.

## Face detection:
    The ability to detect and locate human face.

### 2] Social Distancing
    Social distancing implies thatÂ people should physically distance themselves from one another. 
    Crossing a certain threshold(6 feet) can cause a violation.

## When to use Deep Learning or not over others?
1. Deep Learning out perform other techniques if the data size is large. But with small data size, traditional Machine Learning algorithms are preferable.
2. Deep Learning techniques need to have high end infrastructure to train in reasonable time.
3. When there is lack of domain understanding for feature introspection, Deep Learning techniques outshines others as you have to worry less about feature engineering.
4. Deep Learning really shines when it comes to complex problems such as image classification, natural language processing, and speech recognition.

### 3] Object Detection ðŸ”Ž Using YoloV6:
    - To do object detection, I used the Yolov6 model.
        Object Detection can be performed on:
         * Image.
         * Video.
         * WebCam.

### 5] GreyScale Selection

Extract pixel from an image. For eg: If we want to extract white color. Then extract the pixels that are close to 255.

Steps:
  1. Import all the necessary libraries.
  2. Read , Convert and display image.
  3. Extract the required pixel from image.

### 6] Face Detection On Browser Using TensorFlow.js

Check out the result [here](https://youtu.be/O62iUMlP_Jc).

With TensorFlow.js we can develop ML models in JavaScript, and use ML directly in the browser or in Node.js.

## How it Works
  1. Run existing models.
  2. Retrain existing models.
  3. Develop ML with JS.

## Model Used
 * Simple Face Detection: Detects faces in. images using a 'Single Shot Detector' Architecture with a custom encoder (BlazeFace).

### 7] Semantic Image Segmentation.

Most of the time, I just experimented with object detection and recognition, which creates a bounding box around specific detected objects in an image. 
However, I later came across another technique that can give a precise outline of an object that has been detected in an image. 
This technique is known as Image Segmentation.

### 8] CNN - Skin Cancer Detection

The automatic skin disorders classification can help people in identifying skin disorders that occur and immediately consult with medical personnel to get appropriate medical treatment.
