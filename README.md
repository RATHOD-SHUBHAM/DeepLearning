    All my deep learning and computer vision code will be here.
    
## 1] Face recognition:
    The ability to recognise a person face by looking at the digital image.

## Face detection:
    The ability to detect and locate human face.

## 2] Social Distancing
    Social distancing implies thatÂ people should physically distance themselves from one another. Crossing a certain threshold(6 feet) can cause a violation.
