# DeepLearning
Deep learning (also known as deep structured learning) is part of machine learning methods based on artificial neural networks with representation learning. Learning can be supervised, semi-supervised or unsupervised

## A curated list of my DeepLearning projects: 
### 1] Face recognition:
    The ability to recognise a person face by looking at the digital image.

## Face detection:
    The ability to detect and locate human face.

### 2] Social Distancing
    Social distancing implies thatÂ people should physically distance themselves from one another. 
    Crossing a certain threshold(6 feet) can cause a violation.
