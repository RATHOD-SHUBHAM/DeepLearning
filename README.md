# DeepLearning
Deep learning (also known as deep structured learning) is part of machine learning methods based on artificial neural networks with representation learning. Learning can be supervised, semi-supervised or unsupervised

## A curated list of my DeepLearning projects: 

### 1] Face recognition:
    The ability to recognise a person face by looking at the digital image.

## Face detection:
    The ability to detect and locate human face.

### 2] Social Distancing
    Social distancing implies thatÂ people should physically distance themselves from one another. 
    Crossing a certain threshold(6 feet) can cause a violation.

## When to use Deep Learning or not over others?
1. Deep Learning out perform other techniques if the data size is large. But with small data size, traditional Machine Learning algorithms are preferable.
2. Deep Learning techniques need to have high end infrastructure to train in reasonable time.
3. When there is lack of domain understanding for feature introspection, Deep Learning techniques outshines others as you have to worry less about feature engineering.
4. Deep Learning really shines when it comes to complex problems such as image classification, natural language processing, and speech recognition.

### 3] Object Detection ðŸ”Ž Using YoloV6:
    - To do object detection, I used the Yolov6 model.
        Object Detection can be performed on:
         * Image.
         * Video.
         * WebCam.

    ## Topics Covered: 
        1. Automatically detect lane markings in images. <br />
        2. Detect cars and pedestrians using a trained classifier and with SVM. <br />
        3. Classify traffic signs using Convolutional Neural Networks. <br />
        4. Identify other vehicles in images using template matching.<br />
        5. Build deep neural networks with Tensorflow and Keras.<br />
        6. Analyze and visualize data with Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.<br />
        7. Process image data using OpenCV.<br />
        8. Calibrate cameras in Python, correcting for distortion.<br />
        9. Sharpen and blur images with convolution.<br />
        10. Detect edges in images with Sobel, Laplace, and Canny.<br />

### 5] GreyScale Selection

Extract pixel from an image. For eg: If we want to extract white color. Then extract the pixels that are close to 255.

Steps:
  1. Import all the necessary libraries.
  2. Read , Convert and display image.
  3. Extract the required pixel from image.
