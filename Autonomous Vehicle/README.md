# Autonomous Vehicle: Deep Learning and Computer Vision with Python.

The automotive industry is experiencing a paradigm shift from human-driven automobiles to artificial intelligence-powered vehicles in the automotive industry.



## Topics Covered: 
1. Automatically detect lane markings in images. <br />
2. Detect cars and pedestrians using a trained classifier and with SVM. <br />
3. Classify traffic signs using Convolutional Neural Networks. <br />
4. Identify other vehicles in images using template matching.<br />
5. Build deep neural networks with Tensorflow and Keras.<br />
6. Analyze and visualize data with Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.<br />
7. Process image data using OpenCV.<br />
8. Calibrate cameras in Python, correcting for distortion.<br />
9. Sharpen and blur images with convolution.<br />
10. Detect edges in images with Sobel, Laplace, and Canny.<br />
11. Transform images through translation, rotation, resizing, and perspective transform.<br />
12. Extract image features with HOG.<br />
13. Detect object corners with Harris.<br />
14. Classify data with machine learning techniques including regression, decision trees, Naive Bayes, and SVM.<br />
15. Classify data with artificial neural networks and deep learning.<br />
